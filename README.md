                                                                   Tic Tac Toe

Introduction

The classic Tic Tac Toe game built using Flutter. To enhance the user experience, I implemented cashe helper as the local database, allowing players to enable stop or not. Additionally, I implemented Cubit to efficiently manage the life-cycle of the Widget and state managment.

Features

Single Player : Engage in an exciting challenge against the AI, which employs the powerful MiniMax algorithm - a recursive decision-making approach widely used in game theory. By leveraging the MiniMax algorithm, the AI selects the most optimal moves, assuming the player is making the best possible decisions as well. This makes it an ideal fit for games like Tic Tac Toe, where strategic planning and optimal moves are crucial to secure victory. Prepare for an immersive and intellectually stimulating gaming experience as you take on the AI in this mode. Good luck!

Multiplayer : Compete against friends, set custom names, and choose "X" or "O" to determine the Tic Tac Toe champion!


State Management

In this project, I've utilized two powerful tools for state management in Flutter: Cubit and Bloc.
